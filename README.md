# Joshua's really awesome MCA project

In my project I wish to look at the works of [Andrea Gabrieli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrea_Gabrieli), a composer from the 16th century. The works of Gabrieli are found in audio, notated, and metadata format freely available on the Internet:

* Audio recordings:
  1. [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Andrea+Gabrieli). Often these recordings are synchronised with a score.
  2. Streaming services such as Spotify
  3. [Naxos Music Library](https://www.naxosmusiclibrary.com/)
  4. [Archive.org](https://archive.org/search.php?query=andrea+gabrieli)
* Notated music can be found:
  1. [CPDL](https://www.cpdl.org/wiki/index.php/Andrea_Gabrieli). Both PDFs and MusicXML/engraving files can be found here.
  2. [IMSLP](https://imslp.org/wiki/Category:Gabrieli,_Andrea). Only PDFs, especially old editions can be found.
* Metadata: is freely available through track listings for audio recordings, Gabrieli's Wikipedia page, and biographies of the composer.
